The module is stable and has been used. No options or help page are available. Internationalisation and localisation is not intended. The module is not in the Drupal module repository.

Further development is intended.

## Installation

Save all files to /modules/rorknlcodesnippet/

Enable the modules

## Use

In CKEeditor click the Insert Code Snippet button. The list of languages has now changed to those listed in this module.
